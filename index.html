3. The simulation, built by students in Kennesaw State’s Department of Software Engineering and Game Design and Development for their counterparts at Augusta University’s Medical College of Georgia, 
is the result of several months of research and testing between the state’s only accredited game design program and only public medical school. Originally a student project developed in the serious
 and educational game design course taught by KSU professor Joy Li, it is now being tested by 
first- and second-year medical students studying clinical skills as a potential method of building empathy toward patients afflicted by tremor-based neurological disorders.
